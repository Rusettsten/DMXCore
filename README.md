# DMXCore
###Installation
Reference DMXCore.jar in your project, and use the Java Doc and example source code to create your own project.
IF you do use the code in a project, you do not have to reference me- but you can if you choose to.

If you have any questions/comments/concerns email me at ben@arrigolighting.com
