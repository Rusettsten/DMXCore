# DMXCore
###Installation
Reference DMXCore.jar in your project, and use the Java Doc and example source code to create your own project.
Make sure your project also includes the jd2xx files (.so and .dll)

###Other Info
Works on both ENTTEC Open DMX USB and a Generic FTDI D2XX USB to RS485 Driver.


IF you do use the code in a project, you do not have to reference me- but you can if you choose to.

If you have any questions/comments/concerns email me at ben@arrigolighting.com
